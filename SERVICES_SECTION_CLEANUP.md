## Benefits

✅ **Cleaner Design**: Eliminates redundant descriptive text
✅ **More Direct**: Users immediately see the actual services offered
✅ **Better Focus**: Attention goes straight to the service cards
✅ **Reduced Redundancy**: Service cards already describe what's offered
✅ **Improved Spacing**: More breathing room around the section title
✅ **Streamlined Content**: Lets the service cards speak for themselves

## Maintained Elements

✅ **Section Title**: "Comprehensive Business Solutions" remains
✅ **Service Cards**: All 6 service cards preserved:
   - General Trading
   - E-Commerce Solutions  
   - Procurement Consulting
   - Medical Facilitation
   - Logistics & Freight
   - Advertising & Gifts
✅ **CTA Button**: "View All Services" button maintained
✅ **Animations**: All motion effects and transitions preserved

## Design Philosophy

This cleanup follows the same principle as the Trust section:
- **Show, Don't Tell**: Let the service cards demonstrate capabilities
- **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Less text to process before seeing actual services
- **Improve Hierarchy**: Clear progression from title to services to action
- **Maintain Focus**: Users can quickly scan available services

The "Comprehensive Business Solutions" section now has a cleaner presentation that immediately showcases the six service offerings without redundant explanatory text.
